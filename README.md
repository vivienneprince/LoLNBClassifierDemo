# Naive Bayes Classifier Demo
A Naive Bayes Classifier model implemented in python using only numpy and pandas packages. With small adjustments, this code can be used to preform NB classification on any dataset using only the numerical features (binary is ok). 


It is currently configured to predict League of Legends game outcomes using information from the first 10 minutes of the game.  

An .arff version of the LoL data file, as well as a weka model is included in the weka test folder if you want to validate the results using weka.
